**TypedQuery** is a TypeScript type library designed to help developers to abstract their queries.

It is aimed at decoupling a core application from any query related external dependencies, including ORMs, providing a backbone for building queries in typed trees that can the be smoothly translated to any target ORM or raw queries.
